# Personal Website - [tariqsyed.me](https://www.tariqsyed.me)

This is a repo to hold my personal website for hosting. 

The hosting itself is done via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allows you to simply commit and push your changes to your repository and see the changes take place live at your domain. The domain name was acqiured using [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com), which provides each member of the GitHub Student Developer Pack one free .me domain (for one year). 

The website was primarily written using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. This is my first attempt at a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). Bootstrap was used mostly for the boilerplate and styling, while jQuery was used for the in page functionality. This includes the typing effect on the landing page (used [typing.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)), the fade on scroll animation (used [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)), and the interactive selectable portfolio.
